Project Title: Live Weather Dashboard

Description: The Live Weather Dashboard is a web-based application that provides real-time weather updates for any location worldwide. It displays current conditions, forecasts, and other environmental details in a clean, interactive interface.

Key Features: 🌦️ Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions using APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap). 🗺️ Search by Location: Users can enter a city or use GPS to get local weather details. 📅 5-Day Forecast: Displays upcoming weather trends and temperature predictions. 🎨 Dynamic UI: Backgrounds or icons change based on weather conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.). 📊 Data Visualization: Graphs or charts to show temperature and humidity variations over time. 🌐 Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Challenges: 1.Handling API rate limits and ensuring smooth updates without exceeding usage quotas. 2.Managing data accuracy and handling missing or delayed API responses. 3.Implementing real-time updates efficiently without excessive reloading. 4.Designing an intuitive and visually appealing UI for different screen sizes.

How It Works: User Input / Auto-detection: The user enters a city name or allows GPS access. API Call: The app sends a request to a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI). Data Processing: The API response (JSON) is parsed to extract temperature, humidity, forecast, etc. Display Results: The dashboard updates dynamically to show the current weather and forecast data. Auto-refresh: Weather data can refresh at intervals for live updates.
