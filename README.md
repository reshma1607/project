Project Title: Live Weather Dashboard

Description: 

The Live Weather Dashboard is a web-based application that provides real-time weather updates for any location worldwide. It displays current conditions, forecasts, and other environmental details in a clean, interactive interface.

Key Features: 

1.🌦️ Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions using APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap). 

2.🗺️ Search by Location: Users can enter a city or use GPS to get local weather details.

3.📅 5-Day Forecast: Displays upcoming weather trends and temperature predictions. 

4.🎨 Dynamic UI: Backgrounds or icons change based on weather conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.).

5.📊 Data Visualization: Graphs or charts to show temperature and humidity variations over time. 

6.🌐 Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Challenges: 

1.Handling API rate limits and ensuring smooth updates without exceeding usage quotas. 

2.Managing data accuracy and handling missing or delayed API responses. 

3.Implementing real-time updates efficiently without excessive reloading. 

4.Designing an intuitive and visually appealing UI for different screen sizes.

How It Works: 

1.User Input / Auto-detection: The user enters a city name or allows GPS access. 

2.API Call: The app sends a request to a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI).

3.Data Processing: The API response (JSON) is parsed to extract temperature, humidity, forecast, etc. Display Results: The dashboard updates dynamically to show the current weather and forecast data. 

4.Auto-refresh: Weather data can refresh at intervals for live updates.
